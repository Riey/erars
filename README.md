# erars

*WARNING: This software is still experimental!*

ERA runtime made with Rust

## Why new runtime

There is `Emuera` which has emerged as an alternative to eramaker, but at this point it's very slow and dependent on the Windows platform.

erars provides fast start time and cross-platform support.

## Current start time

In my machine (r7 5800x) loading eraTHYMKR(about 1,445,295 ERB lines) with Emuera takes 7 seconds.

And with erars, it takes 0.5 second. Note that this program supports multi threading.
